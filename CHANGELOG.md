## [0.8.0] — 2021-11-09

- Added: The new set of functions which verify Ethash hashes against difficulty
  has been added to the library: `verify_against_difficulty()` and
  `verify_final_hash_against_difficulty()`. These functions improve usability
  by omitting previously required difficulty to boundary conversion.
  The old verification function is still available under
  the `verify_against_boundary()` name but its usage is discouraged.
  [#195](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/195)
- Added: The dedicated procedure to convert difficulty to boundary
  `ethash_difficulty_to_boundary()` has been added to the testing infrastructure
  but can be promoted to the public API if requested.
  [#191](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/191)
- Deprecated: `verify()` has been deprecated and replaced with
  `verify_against_boundary()`.
  [#193](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/193)
- Deprecated: `verify_final_hash()` has been replaced by
  `verify_final_hash_against_difficulty()`.
  [#200](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/200)
- Deprecated: The ProgPoW support has been deprecated and will be removed 
  in the next release.
  [#201](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/201)
- Changed: The internal hash type comparison operators have been 
  optimized and the dependency on the `memcmp()` function has been dropped.
  [#186](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/186)
- Changed: Verification functions now return error codes instead of `bool`
  with additional information about which verification check has failed.
  [#187](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/187)
  - In C API error codes are represented by the `ethash_errc` enum,
  - In C++ the error codes are wrapped into `std::error_code`.
- Changed: Some build requirements have been increased.
  - C11 is required (previously C99),
    [#188](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/188)
  - C++14 is required (previously C++11),
    [#189](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/189)
  - CMake 3.16 is required (previously 3.13),
    [#205](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/205)
  - Python wheels are now built with `manylinux_2_24`.
    [#194](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/194)


## [0.7.1] — 2021-08-26

 - Added: Support for building with clang-cl (LLVM-based toolchain for Visual Studio 2019).
   [#179](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/179)

## [0.7.0] — 2021-05-26

 - Changed: The global context API (aka "managed" API) has been moved to
   separate library `ethash::global-context` and `ethash/global_context.hpp`
   header.
   [#175](https://github.com/chfast/ethash/pull/175)
 - Added: CMake options to disable building of individual libraries:
   - `-DETHASH_BUILD_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=NO` disables building
     `ethash::global-context`.
   - `-DETHASH_BUILD_ETHASH=NO` disables building `ethash::ethash` and
     `ethash::global-context`. Only `ethash::keccak` is built then.

## [0.6.0] — 2020-12-15

   which uses BMI and BMI2 x86_64 extensions. This implementation is automatically
   selected at startup provided the used extensions are available in the hardware.
